# Advent Of Code 2024 Solutions ⭐

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2024! 🎄✨  
Each day of December, I tackle a new programming challenge designed to improve problem-solving skills and embrace the holiday spirit. My goal is to provide solutions for every day's problem.

### Repository Structure 📂
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific day and contains:

The repository contains:

- A folder for each day with my `Python` solution.
- A `progress.json` file at the root that tracks my progress.
- A script to automatically update the progress table in the `README`.

### Progress Overview 📈
Below is a summary of my progress through Advent of Code 2024.  
Each day has:

- ⭐ A golden star if I have completed the challenge.
- ⚪ A gray star if I have not yet tackled it.
- A link to my solution.

| Day  | Part 1 | Part 2 | Solution Link               |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | ⭐      | ⭐      | [Solution]() |

| ...  | ...    | ...    | ...                         |

> **Note**: I will update this table daily as I progress through the challenges!
